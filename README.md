## Frontend Challenge Calendar: 30 Days of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is a 30-day project to practice and improve my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Throughout this calendar, I will be doing 30 different challenges to explore various concepts and basic web development techniques. 

The practice calendar was made by Pau Zuffinetti.

I decided to do this challenge because I believe that as a frontend developer, I should be able to master simple things like these.  ପ(๑•ᴗ•๑)ଓ ♡
