                <p>Cat (Felis catus), also known as a house cat or domestic cat, is a domesticated member of the Felidae
                    family and the smallest member of the Carnivora order.</p>

            <h1>Characteristics</h1>
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat. It averages about 46 cm
                (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails.
                Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).</p>
            <h3>Skeleton</h3>
            <p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven
                lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five);
                and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal
                vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's
                spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis. Unlike
                human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them
                to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.</p>
            <h3>Skull</h3>
            <p>he cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.
                Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey,
                a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the
                prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death. Compared to
                other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which
                is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.</p>
            <h3>Claws</h3>
            <p>Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed
                with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from
                contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are
                typically sharper than those on the hindfeet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more
                paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction
                on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.</p>
            <h3>Ambulation</h3>
            <p>The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the
                visible leg. Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body
                before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of
                the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for
                hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a
                "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.</p>
            <h3>Balance</h3>
            <p>Cats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed
                site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch.
                Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to
                survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its
                paws.</p>

        <section id="senses" class="info-general">
            <h1>Senses</h1>
            <p>Cats, like humans, have five senses. But there is also a popular belief that domestic cats have a sixth
                sense—the ability to find their way home over long distances.</p>
            <h3>Touch</h3>
            <p>The sense of touch is acute in cats. The whiskers (vibrissae) are touch receptors that are vital to the
                cat’s hunting ability. The eyebrows and hairs of the cheek, chin, legs, and ears are extremely sensitive
                to vibrations and provide cats with a great deal of information. This cat “radar” is vital to the cat’s
                ability to move about and hunt in low-light conditions. The paw pads are also acutely sensitive and help
                the cat when grasping prey.</p>
            <h3>Hearing and “seeing Martians”</h3>
            <p>Cats have a keen sense of hearing. Their ears are mobile and can move independently of one other,
                allowing cats to pinpoint sounds with accuracy. The cat’s hearing is tuned to higher frequencies because
                the sounds of its usual prey are generally higher pitched. They can detect frequencies both above and
                below the range humans can detect.</p>
            <h3>Taste</h3>
            <p>The cat’s tongue is covered by numerous sensory knobs called papillae, of which several types exist. In
                the center of the tongue, the papillae form backward-pointing hooks that rasp meat from the bones of
                prey and scoop up water when the cat drinks. The taste receptors are located on the front, sides, and
                back of the tongue. However, the cat has relatively few taste receptors—only 473 compared with humans’
                9,000.</p>
            <h3>Smell</h3>
            <p>Cats’ sense of smell is vastly better than that of humans: they have 200 million odor sensors compared
                with humans’ 5 million. Their sense of smell is crucial to sensing prey and evaluating food. Cats whose
                nasal passages become clogged because of illness may lose their appetites. In addition, cats have a
                special sense best described as a cross between taste and smell. The Jacobson’s, or vomeronasal, organ
                is situated between the nose and the palate, and cats access this sense by “flehming,” which looks like
                a cat grimace or sneer. Cats use this sense to examine odors they find interesting.</p>
            <h3>Sight and “glowing eyes”</h3>
            <p>Domestic cats are “crepuscular”—active at dawn and dusk. The pupils of the eyes expand or contract
                according to the intensity of light. Cats have nictitating membranes (third eyelids) that protect the
                eyeballs from damage. Color perception is not highly developed in cats, likely because it is unimportant
                to their survival; detecting a prey animal’s movements is more important than observing its colors.</p>
            <h3>Cats’ “sixth sense”</h3>
            <p>Although experts doubt the existence of this “sixth sense,” many anecdotal accounts contend that cats
                have an unidentified sense that allows them to find their way home, sometimes over distances of hundreds
                of miles. No one knows how cats accomplish this feat, but theories abound, including that cats use
                Earth’s magnetic fields to negotiate their way back to familiar territory.</p>

        <section id="facts" class="info-general">
            <h1>Facts</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>As kittens they have 26 deciduous, or “baby”, teeth. As adult cats they have 30 permanent teeth.
                    Don’t forget to take care of those pearly whites with regular dental cleanings.</li>
                <li>House cats share 95.6% of their genetic makeup with tigers. You read that right, TIGERS. They also
                    share some of the same behavior habits such as scent and urine marking, prey stalking and pouncing.
                </li>
                <li>Cats can jump 5 times their own height. Now that’s impressive!</li>
                <li>A housecat can run to the speed of about 30 mph over short distances. This means that a cat can
                    outrun superstar runner Usain Bolt in a 200 meter dash!</li>
                <li>Ever wondered why your feline friend would often put their rear end by your face? This is actually a
                    sign of trust and your cat signaling that they feel safe and secure around you.</li>
                <li>Cats can have a dominant front paw. Studies have shown that male cats tend to favor their left paw
                    while female cats may have a dominant right paw.</li>
                <li>Most cats have 18 toes, 5 on their front paws and 4 on their back paws. However, some cats can be
                    born with “extra toes”, a condition called polydactylism.</li>
                <li>The oldest cat to ever live was Creme Puff, who lived to be 38 years and 3 days old. Creme Puff
                    lived from August 3, 1967 to August 2005 with her owner in Austin, Texas.</li>
                <li>Cats have a whopping 32 muscles in each of their ears, allowing them to swivel their ears to hone in
                    on the exact source of a noise. Additionally, cats can rotate their ears to 180 degrees!</li>
                <li>Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are far superior compared to
                    humans.</li>
                <li>The whiskers on a cat aren’t just cute, they serve a very important function in assisting cats with
                    getting around, especially at night. Whiskers are embedded deep in the cat’s body and are connected
                    to the cat’s sensitive muscular and nervous systems, acting as touch receptors (or a “kitty radar”).
                    Whiskers allow a cat to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings.</li>
                <li>Additionally, not only do cats have whiskers on their face, they also have a set of whiskers on the
                    back of their front legs. </li>
                <li>The wealthiest cat in the world, Blackie, had a fortune of £7 million or $12.5 million in US
                    dollars. When Blackie’s millionaire owner passed away, the owner refused to acknowledge any human
                    family members in his will and instead gifted his massive fortune to his last surviving cat. Now
                    that is one lucky cat!</li>
                <li>The oldest known pet cat existed around 9,500 years ago. In 2004, a French archeologist found a
                    grave of a cat in Cyprus dating back to 9,500 years ago, meaning that humans have owned cats as pets
                    since then!</li>
                <li>A female cat can become pregnant as young as 4 - 6 months of age. Spaying and neutering your cat
                    around this age is the best way to prevent any unexpected litters and help reduce cat
                    overpopulation.</li>
                <li>Although a group of kittens are more commonly called a litter, they can also be known as a “kindle”
                    of kittens.</li>
                <li>Cats usually sleep around an average of 15 hours PER day. This means that a cat spends roughly 70%
                    of their lives sleeping. Must be nice to be a cat!</li>
                <li>In Ancient Egypt, members of a family would shave their eyebrows in mourning if their cat died. Cats
                    were also sometimes mummified and placed in tombs with their owners. </li>
